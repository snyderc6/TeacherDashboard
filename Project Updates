Difficulties/Comments
- Study had a saving issue
- Switched to a different data set
- I don't think I can put the student data on github but am going to check with my advisor to make sure

Progress
- Extracted all the actions from the xml project files into a csv
- Played around with stardust and d3
- A little behind due to data issues
